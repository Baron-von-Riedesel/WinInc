  08/08/2012 V2.03

  - in a few include files, prototypes <MIDL_user_allocate> and 
    <MIDL_user_free> weren't commented out yet. Those prototypes may cause
    problems if Masm is used, because due to a Masm bug, if a prototype is 
    included multiple times, it becomes an external that has to be resolved
    by the linker.
  - in file MsHtmHst.inc, there was more than one prototype of ShowHTMLDialog,
    which may also be a problem for Masm.
  - SHLWAPI.INC: Masm didn't digest LWSTDAPI_ macro.
  - OBJBASE.INC: STDMETHODV macro did contain calling convention C, which isn't
    correct for Win64.

  07/03/2012 V2.02

    changed DWORD to SIZE_T selectively to make the definitions match the
    ones for C in the PSDK.

    changed DWORD to ULONG_PTR and SDWORD to LONG_PTR selectively to make
    the definitions match the ones for C in the PSDK.
  - STDLIB.INC, STDIO.INC, STRING.INC: size of size_t changed to 64-bit
    for Win64.
  - WINBASE.INC, WINGDI.INC, WINUSER.INC, OAIDL.INC, OCIDL.INC, WINIOCTL.INC,
    WININET.INC, WINSOCK.INC, WINSOCK2.INC, OBJIDL.INC:
    all structures with alignment argument 4 changed to align 8.
  - WINUSER.INC, WINSOCK2.INC, WINREG.INC, WININET.INC, WINBASE.INC, 
    URLMON.INC, RPCASYNC.INC, RICHEDIT.INC, MSACM.INC, MMSYSTEM.INC,
    DDEML.INC, COMMCTRL.INC:
    changed DWORD to DWORD_PTR selectively to make the definitions match
    the ones for C in the PSDK.
  - some exports in KERNEL.DEF didn't belong to KERNEL32.DLL, but to
    ADVAPI32.DLL. Entries moved to new file ADVAPI32.DEF.

  03/19/2011 V2.01a

  - winnt.inc, win64 only: definition of Xmm_ members in CONTEXT structure
    was wrong ( "?" instead of <> was used as initializer for a struct
    member ).

  03/12/2011 V2.01
